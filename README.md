## Description

This project is a Power BI dashboard for healthcare analytics. It transforms raw healthcare data into an interactive and informative dashboard, providing insights into **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as medication costs, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and billing amounts. The dashboard allows users to filter data by various dimensions like patient race, time periods, and location, offering a comprehensive view of healthcare financial data.
