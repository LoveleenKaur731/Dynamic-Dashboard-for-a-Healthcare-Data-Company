# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

---

A comprehensive Power BI project analyzing key performance metrics in the healthcare domain — helping providers, administrators, and policy-makers improve operational efficiency, billing management, and patient care quality.

---

## Project Summary

This project leverages multiple healthcare datasets to deliver an end-to-end data analysis solution using **Power BI**. The final dashboard provides deep insights into **billing**, **procedures**, **insurance coverage**, **departmental performance**, and **diagnosis patterns** — all of which are vital to effective healthcare management.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze hospital billing, medication, treatment, and room charges.
- Evaluate provider and department performance.
- Identify trends in diagnoses and procedures.
- Understand the financial impact across cities and insurance categories.
- Enable data-driven healthcare decisions.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – for interactive dashboard and data modeling.
- **CSV Files** – raw data sources for healthcare entities.
- **Data Modeling** – relationship mapping using unique identifiers (`patient_id`, `visit_id`, etc.)
